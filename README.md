## Problem Statement

Input subsidy programs (ISPs) in Sub-Saharan Africa face several critical challenges:

- **Fraud and Elite Capture**: Inefficiencies and misuse of resources undermine program effectiveness.
- **Gender Bias**: Existing programs often disadvantage marginalized women.
- **Lack of Specificity**: Blanket approaches fail to address individual needs effectively.

These issues prevent ISPs from ensuring food security. A more innovative and verifiable solution is necessary to improve the distribution of agricultural inputs.

## Proposed Solution

The **Smart TRAIS Tool** leverages **Digital ID** to enhance the distribution of agricultural subsidies:

### Digital ID Integration

- **Verification and Traceability**: Links subsidies to Digital IDs, ensuring secure and traceable distribution.
- **API Integration**: Public and private entities fetch Digital IDs to determine subsidy eligibility and class.
